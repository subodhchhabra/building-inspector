### Environment variables and buildpacks

#### Deploying in Heroku

**UPDATE (2016/06/29):** Heroku now properly [handles multiple buildpacks natively](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app).

This project makes use of several environment variables and buildpacks to work on Heroku. The RGeo gem in Heroku does not get built properly so some tasks do not work. You need to include these two buildpacks:

- https://github.com/peterkeen/heroku-buildpack-vendorbinaries.git
- https://github.com/diowa/heroku-buildpack-rgeo-prep.git

You can do so by executing:

    heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/peterkeen/heroku-buildpack-vendorbinaries.git
    heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/diowa/heroku-buildpack-rgeo-prep.git

In order to verify that everything is working fine, enter the Heroku Rails console in the application and type:

    RGeo::Geos.supported?

This should return `=> true`. If this is not the case you may want to visit the [issues list for `heroku-geo-buildpack`](https://github.com/cyberdelia/heroku-geo-buildpack/issues).

#### Social media login integration

This application makes use of [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) which requires that you set up the necessary API keys for [Google](https://developers.google.com/+/api/oauth#apikey), [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth) and [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/v2.3) (links take you to the applicable area for each platform). Once procured, you need to set the following environment variables to their proper values:

- `FACEBOOK_KEY`
- `FACEBOOK_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_SECRET`
- `TWITTER_KEY`
- `TWITTER_SECRET`

##### Google URIs

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure under "APIs" that you have the "Contacts API" and "Google+ API" enabled for this application.

In the `APIs & auth > Credentials` section of the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) you need to create a **Client ID for OAuth** and set these values (replace `{APPLICATION_URL}` with the proper URL of the application):

- `Redirect URIs`: `http://{APPLICATION_URL}/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback`
- `Javascript Origins`: `http://{APPLICATION_URL}`

### <a name="ingest"></a>Data ingest

This project works with GeoJSON files generated by the [NYPL Map Vectorizer]. The specific files for the NYPL use case are found in the [/public/files](public/files/) folder.

#### Read [Importing Map Warper layers into Building Inspector](README_WARPER_IMPORT.md) for more detailed ingest instructions.

#### First ingest

After downloading, and running the proper `rake db:migrate` you need to do a base ingest of data using the included rake task.

#### All sheet data ingest

**NOTE: You may need to prepend `bundle exec` to the Rake tasks if you're using Rails 4.**

`rake data_import:ingest_bulk id=LAYERNAME force=true`

This assumes the presence of `public/files/config-ingest-layerLAYERNAME.json` with a list of IDs and bounding boxes to import for the layer `LAYERNAME`. It will create a `layer` whose `external_id` is the `LAYERNAME` provided. This **erases all sheet/polygon/flag data** for those IDs in the config file. If you don't have a config file, see the next section for instruction on how to build one easily.

#### Layer ingest config file creator

There is an included Python script -- `ingestor_config_builder.py` -- to easily create ingest config files to be used in the inspector. It assumes a folder full of GeoTIFF files (sheets) that you have vectorized and want to create in the database.

Usage:

`python ingestor_config_builder.py /path/to/folder/with/geotiffs`

It creates a config file in the application root folder with the name `config-ingest-layerFOLDERNAME` where `FOLDERNAME` is the name of the folder where the GeoTIFFs were found. In NYPL, the `FOLDERNAME` is the same as the `LAYERNAME`.

#### Single sheet data ingest

`rake data_import:ingest_geojson id=SOMEID layer_id=SOMELAYERID bbox=SOMEBOUNDINGBOX force=true`

This imports polygons from a file `public/files/SOMEID-traced.json` into the database **replacing** any polygons (and its corresponding flags) that are associated to a sheet with `map_id` equal to `SOMEID`. **IMPORTANT:** There has to be a `layer` whose `id` is equal to `SOMELAYERID` for the links to work! This **is not** the layer's `external_id`.

**NOTE:** (this only applies if you want to use NYPL polygons) ~~So far only layers 859 and 860 are provided.~~ Layer 859 has separate GeoJSON for centroids and polygons. Layer 860 sheets have a single file with both fields. Ingesting 859 requires a separate `data_import:ingest_centroid_bulk` process for centroids. See above script.

#### Centroids

**NOTE:** The vectorizer now adds centroids to the polygons vectorized. In case you have a GeoJSON file with polygons and no centroids, use this script below. Otherwise, **you do not need these rake tasks**.

##### Add bulk centroids

~~The original GeoJSON files do not have centroids (they were added and processed later).~~ To create the centroids of the polygons in the database you need to run:

`rake data_import:ingest_centroid_bulk id=LAYERNAME force=true`

##### Single sheet centroid updating

This updates the polygon centroids for a given `sheet_id` from a file `public/files/SOMEID-traced.json` **replacing** any existing polygon centroids (not the polygons themselves):

`rake data_import:ingest_centroids_for_sheet id=SOMEID force=true`

### <a name="consensus"></a>Consensus generation

As people inspect polygons according to the task (eg. "YES/NO/FIX" for the geometry task) they are essentially casting a vote alongside fellow inspectors. We show the same polygon and task to several people and tally up those votes to decide whether they agree. If they do, that polygon is removed from the pool for that given task.

Each task has a different means to come to consensus. So far, consensus for `geometry`, `color` and basic `address` (value being `NONE`) are implemented. A rake task is available for this in `lib/tasks/flag_processing.rake`:

````
rake db:calculate_consensus
````

This task should be scheduled to execute regularly (say, every ten minutes). New consensus generation for other tasks is being implemented.

### <a name="rankings"></a>Calculating user rankings

The homepage of the site shows, for users who authenticate via Facebook, Google, or Twitter, their ranking in terms of amount of inspections. This is performed by the tasks in `lib/tasks/user.rake`:

````
rake user:calculate_scores
````

This task should be scheduled to execute regularly (every hour or so).

### <a name="api"></a>API querying

See a complete description in the [Data page](http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/data).

### <a name="tasks"></a>Adding new tasks

There is a very superficial [README document](README_NEW_TASK.md) briefly describing what changes need to be made to add new tasks to the Building Inspector.
